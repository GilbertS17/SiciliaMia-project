This website is done by using node.js to create a react app and used in it Bootstrap grid system for better responsive design and I used font awesome where I got the search logo and the link logo.
The code got many comments which will help you understand it

PS: The search field and didn't store the data to mongodb because I didn't learn these but I have the curiosity to learn while working for your company! 




                                                !!!IMPORTANT!!!  



    The website will not show the data directly because the API is not fetching data because it has maximum request limit.
    To fix this you should do these next steps:
    1- Go to App.js, uncomment cards where I declared it first. (lines: 23 -> 29)
    2- Then uncomment line 40 where I used  "{cards}"
    3- Comment the h1 showing the text "Go to README.md" line 43 (optional)
