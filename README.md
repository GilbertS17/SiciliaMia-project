This website is done by using node.js to create a react app and used in it Bootstrap grid system for better responsive design and I used font awesome where I got the search logo and the link logo.
The code got many comments which will help you understand it




                                    !!!IMPORTANT!!!  



    If the website shows a blank page, it is because the api is not fetching the data because the API has maximum request limit.
    To fix this you should:
    1- Comment {cards} both where it is declared and after the return in App.js 
    2- Uncommenting the h1 which has a text of Hello world so it is displayed in the website
    3- Go to the console and see what the console is logging out 
    4- If it is an empty array than refresh the webpage untill it logs an object with 1420 items
    5- When it logs this object comment the h1 that you uncommented before
    6- Uncomment "cards" where it is declared then uncomment it after thr return (In that order!)
    7- Now the cards data should appear to the webpage
